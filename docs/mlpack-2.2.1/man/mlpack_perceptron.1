.SH DESCRIPTION


This program implements a perceptron, which is a single level neural network.
The perceptron makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function
combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The perceptron learning
rule is able to converge, given enough iterations using the \fB--max_iterations\fP
(\fB-n\fP) parameter, if the data supplied is linearly separable. The perceptron is
parameterized by a matrix of weight vectors that denote the numerical weights
of the neural network.
.PP
This program allows loading a perceptron from a model (\fB-m\fP) or training a
perceptron given training data (\fB-t\fP), or both those things at once. In
addition, this program allows classification on a test dataset (\fB-T\fP) and will
save the classification results to the given output file (\fB-o\fP). The perceptron
model itself may be saved with a file specified using the \fB-M\fP option.
.PP
The training data given with the \fB-t\fP option should have class labels as its
last dimension (so, if the training data is in CSV format, labels should be
the last column). Alternately, the \fB-l\fP (\fB--labels_file\fP) option may be used to
specify a separate file of labels.
.PP
All these options make it easy to train a perceptron, and then re-use that
perceptron for later classification. The invocation below trains a perceptron
on 'training_data.csv' (and 'training_labels.csv)' and saves the model to
\(cqperceptron.xml'.
.PP
$ perceptron \fB-t\fP training_data.csv \fB-l\fP training_labels.csv \fB-M\fP perceptron.xml
.PP
Then, this model can be re-used for classification on 'test_data.csv'. The
example below does precisely that, saving the predicted classes to
\(cqpredictions.csv'.
.PP
$ perceptron \fB-m\fP perceptron.xml \fB-T\fP test_data.csv \fB-o\fP predictions.csv
.PP
Note that all of the options may be specified at once: predictions may be
calculated right after training a model, and model training can occur even if
an existing perceptron model is passed with \fB-m\fP (\fB--input_model_file\fP). However,
note that the number of classes and the dimensionality of all data must match.
So you cannot pass a perceptron model trained on 2 classes and then re-train
with a 4-class dataset. Similarly, attempting classification on a
3-dimensional dataset with a perceptron that has been trained on 8 dimensions
will cause an error.
