.SH DESCRIPTION


This program implements range search with a Euclidean distance metric. For a
given query point, a given range, and a given set of reference points, the
program will return all of the reference points with distance to the query
point in the given range. This is performed for an entire set of query
points. You may specify a separate set of reference and query points, or only
a reference set -- which is then used as both the reference and query set. 
The given range is taken to be inclusive (that is, points with a distance
exactly equal to the minimum and maximum of the range are included in the
results).
.PP
For example, the following will calculate the points within the range [2, 5]
of each point in 'input.csv' and store the distances in 'distances.csv' and
the neighbors in 'neighbors.csv':
.PP
$ \fBrange_search\fP \fB--min\fP=2 \fB--max\fP=5 \fB--reference_file\fP=input.csv
\fB--distances_file\fP=distances.csv \fB--neighbors_file\fP=neighbors.csv
.PP
The output files are organized such that line i corresponds to the points
found for query point i. Because sometimes 0 points may be found in the given
range, lines of the output files may be empty. The points are not ordered in
any specific manner.
.PP
Because the number of points returned for each query point may differ, the
resultant CSV-like files may not be loadable by many programs. However, at
this time a better way to store this non-square result is not known. As a
result, any output files will be written as CSVs in this manner, regardless of
the given extension.
