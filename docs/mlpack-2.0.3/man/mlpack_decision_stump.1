.SH DESCRIPTION


This program implements a decision stump, which is a single-level decision
tree. The decision stump will split on one dimension of the input data, and
will split into multiple buckets. The dimension and bins are selected by
maximizing the information gain of the split. Optionally, the minimum number
of training points in each bin can be specified with the \fB--bucket_size\fP (\fB-b\fP)
parameter.
.PP
The decision stump is parameterized by a splitting dimension and a vector of
values that denote the splitting values of each bin.
.PP
This program enables several applications: a decision tree may be trained or
loaded, and then that decision tree may be used to classify a given set of
test points. The decision tree may also be saved to a file for later usage.
.PP
To train a decision stump, training data should be passed with the
\fB--training_file\fP (\fB-t\fP) option, and their corresponding labels should be passed
with the \fB--labels_file\fP (\fB-l\fP) option. Optionally, if \fB--labels_file\fP is not
specified, the labels are assumed to be the last dimension of the training
dataset. The \fB--bucket_size\fP (\fB-b\fP) parameter controls the minimum number of
training points in each decision stump bucket.
.PP
For classifying a test set, a decision stump may be loaded with the
\fB--input_model_file\fP (\fB-m\fP) parameter (useful for the situation where a stump has
not just been trained), and a test set may be specified with the \fB--test_file\fP
(\fB-T\fP) parameter. The predicted labels will be saved to the file specified with
the \fB--predictions_file\fP (\fB-p\fP) parameter.
.PP
Because decision stumps are trained in batch, retraining does not make sense
and thus it is not possible to pass both \fB--training_file\fP and
\fB--input_model_file\fP; instead, simply build a new decision stump with the
training data.
.PP
A trained decision stump can be saved with the \fB--output_model_file\fP (\fB-M\fP)
option. That stump may later be re-used in subsequent calls to this program
(or others).
