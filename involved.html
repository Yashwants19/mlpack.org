<center><h2><font class="whitebold">contributing to
mlpack</font></h2></center>
<p><font class="whitebold">mlpack</font> is an open-source project, so anyone is
welcome to become a part of the community and contribute.  There is no need to
be a machine learning expert to participate&mdash;often, there are many tasks to
be done that don't require in-depth knowledge.</p>
<p>A good place to start is to <a href="download.html">download</a> <font
class="whitebold">mlpack</font>, compile it from source (<a
href="docs/mlpack-2.0.2/doxygen.php?doc=build.html">tutorial</a>), and set up a
development environment.  Once you've done this, it would probably be useful to
get a feel for some of the algorithms <font class="whitebold">mlpack</font>
implements by using some of the command-line programs (<a
href="docs/mlpack-2.0.2/man.html">man pages</a>) to perform some machine
learning tasks.</p> <p>Next, you can implement some <a
href="docs/mlpack-2.0.2/doxygen.php?doc=sample.html">simple mlpack programs</a>
and read through the <a
href="docs/mlpack-2.0.2/doxygen.php?doc=tutorials.html">other tutorials</a>, and
by the time you've finished with that you should have a pretty good handle on
the way the library works.</p> <p>At this point, you're probably ready to jump
in and start contributing.  Development is done <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack">on Github</a>, so you'll need an account
there, and you can submit patches or contributions via <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull requests</a>.
Below are some useful links and tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find a bug to solve on the <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues">issues list</a>.  Issues
(generally) have a <i>difficulty</i> label, which may help in selecting an issue
that is interesting to you.</li><br>
<li>Read the <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/DesignGuidelines">design
guidelines</a> to get insight on how to structure your contributions and to
learn what your code should look like when you submit it.</li><br>
<li>Subscribe to the <a
href="http://lists.cc.gatech.edu/mailman/listinfo/mlpack">mlpack</a> discussion
mailing list to receive (or send) emails about <font
class="whitebold">mlpack</font>.</li><br>
<li>You may find it useful to subscribe to the <a
href="http://lists.cc.gatech.edu/mailman/listinfo/mlpack-git">mlpack-git</a>
mailing list to receive updates on git commits and Github issues (warning: can
be high-traffic).</li><br>
<li>We maintain a <a href="gsocblog/">development blog</a> where you can read
about the progress of Google Summer of Code projects and other updates.</li><br>
<li>The #mlpack IRC channel on freenode (<a
href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mlpack">webchat</a>, <a
href="irc/">channel logs</a>) is a good place to ask for help or discuss <font
class="whitebold">mlpack</font> with other members of the community.</li><br>
<li>Are you interested in a more long-term project?  See the <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas">list of ideas</a>
we maintain for Google Summer of Code</a>, and maybe that can provide a good
starting point.</li>
</ul>
