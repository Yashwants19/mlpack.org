<center><h2><font class="whitebold">mlpack and google summer of
code</font></h2></center>
<p><font class="whitebold">mlpack</font> is a proud participant in <a
href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of
Code</a>.  We have been a part of the program in 2013, 2014, and 2016, with a
total of 14 students accepted for mlpack.  In the past, we have received very
many applications and it is a competitive process, so this page exists to help
you determine if you could be a strong candidate.</p>
<p>The two most important qualities that an mlpack GSoC candidate can possess is
the <b>ability to be self-sufficient</b> and the <b>willingness to
learn</b>.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency is key because mentors have limited time and can't put in as
much time helping the student as the student is putting in.  However, this of
course does not mean that a student (or a prospective student) can never ask any
questions!  mlpack is a complex library and can sometimes take help and
explanation to understand.</p>
<p>A willingness to learn is also important because virtually every potential
project will require the student to become familiar with a new algorithm or C++
technique.  mlpack is a complex library with many components and it is likely
during your project that you might have to use or interact with some other part
of the codebase.</p>
<p>Of course, these are not the only important ingredients for a successful GSoC
project.  A student should ideally be familiar with
<ul>
<li><b>open source software development</b>: opening pull requests, using git,
   opening issues.  mlpack uses Github, which has <a
href="https://guides.github.com/">great documentation</a>.
   You can learn about the workflow using that link, if you are not already
   familiar.</li>
<br>
<li><b>using the development toolchain on your computer</b>: you should be able
   to download and compile mlpack, make changes to the code, and recompile with
   the new changes.  There is <a
href="http://mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-git/doxygen.php?doc=build.html">a
tutorial</a> for how to build mlpack and would be a
   great place to get started.  If you're on Windows, then <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/WindowsBuild">this wiki page</a>
could be very useful.</li>
<br>
<li><b>at least intermediate C++ knowledge</b>: mlpack uses lots of different C++
   paradigms including template metaprogramming, C++11 features like rvalue
   references, and different parts of the Boost libraries, in order to make the
   code fast.  You should be at least familiar with some of these language
   features and what templates are, even if you have not used them in-depth, so
   that you can understand the mlpack codebase.  Some examples of patterns that
   are often used inside of mlpack are <a
href="http://shaharmike.com/cpp/sfinae/">SFINAE</a> (<a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/blob/565cfd3aad22deec0656b86e801052593a937723/src/mlpack/methods/mean_shift/mean_shift.hpp#L123">example
in mlpack</a>),
   <a
href="http://www.drdobbs.com/policy-based-design-in-the-real-world/184401861">policy-based
design</a>, and <a href="https://accu.org/index.php/journals/442">compile-time
class traits</a>.  If some of this sounds new to you, don't feel
overwhelmed---it's not a necessity, but it is helpful.  You should at least be
prepared to learn about it!</li>
<br>
<li><b>project-specific knowledge</b>: you'll need to have an in-depth
   understanding of the specific project that you choose.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For this last bit, a project should be chosen.  There are many projects on the
<a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas">SummerOfCodeIdeas
page</a> to be selected from.  Find one that interests you---or
propose your own and see if a mentor is interested in supervising the project!
If you have any questions about a project, be aware that it's possible that the
question has already been answered on the <a
href="http://lists.mlpack.org/mailman/listinfo/mlpack">mailing list</a>. Take a look through
<a href="http://knife.lugatgt.org/pipermail/mlpack/">the archives</a> or <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&q=site%3Aknife.lugatgt.org%2Fpipermail%2Fmlpack%2F+%3Cyour+search+query%3E&oq=site%3Aknife.lugatgt.org%2Fpipermail%2Fmlpack%2F+%3Cyour+search+query%3E&gs_l=serp.3...4714.5080.0.5256.2.2.0.0.0.0.35.67.2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.0.0.ynWRnMmHXEU">search</a>
to see if there's already an answer to your question.</p>
<p>There are a couple options for how to start contributing to mlpack.  The
first is to look through the <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues">list of open issues</a> and see
if there is any issue you think you can solve.  The issues are generally tagged
with difficulty, so you can search for, e.g., <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22D%3A+easy%22">only
"easy" issues</a>.  Another approach is to find a bug in the mlpack code and
solve it.  And yet another approach is to contribute new functionality.  As
always, be patient---it may be some time before a community member is able to
fully review your PR.  Be sure that it
follows the <a
href="https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/wiki/DesignGuidelines">style
guidelines</a> to help keep things moving quickly.</p>
<p>Remember that open source is about community---so be sure to participate!</p>
